# Design Thinking

## Elements of Design Thinking

1. **WHO**: think about who will be the end users, and go deep into the characteristics (customer persona) of the user group. Try to develop a representative model of this group of customers.

2. **WHAT**: Understand the problems that the group of customers are facing, and disect the problems.

3. **HOW**: Leverage intelligence to address the identified problems. Analyse the costs and expected returns/deliverables. Present the collective wisdom as a holistic solution.
