# Something about Design

There are Five creational design pattern:
1. Abstract factory groups object factories that have a common theme.
2. Builder constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
3. Factory method creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
4. Prototype creates objects by cloning an existing object.
5. Singleton restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

* Refactoring

Refactoring is a technique to improve the quality of existing code. It works by applying a series of small steps, each of which changes the internal structure of the code, while maintaining its external behavior. You begin with a program that runs correctly, but is not well structured, refactoring improves its structure, making it easier to maintain and extend.

* Factory Mode

In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
